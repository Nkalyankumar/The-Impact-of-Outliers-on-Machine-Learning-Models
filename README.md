# TheImpactOfOutliersOnMachineLearningModels

# Description

This Exercise delves into the effects of outliers on machine learning models and how they alter the behavior of algorithms and distract predictions.The ultimate goal is to show  the challenges faced when Outliers are not detected.



# The Observation goes like this
